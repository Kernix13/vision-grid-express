# VisionGrid

## To-Do

1. Home page: mostly done, just little CSS changes and I need to check for mobile which I have not done at att, and other edge cases
2. Board page:
   1. create toggleSettingsForm() to toggle the settings form visibility - I may have users set how their modal display, and maybe their on page layout, and maybe to have multiple boards
   2. create toggleThumbnails: toggle the thumbnails visibility - I did this but I can not get any kind of click listener on them. I also want to somehow hide/display buttone to move an image up/down, and to delete an image
   3. import the localStorage functions and hambuger menu functions
   4. create addSavedImagesToDom to add saved images to DOM, show editable image notes
   5. I think I will need a DOMContentLoaded listener and one to save editable text to local storage
   6. finally I need a modal for saved images - something way different and better than the home page modal
