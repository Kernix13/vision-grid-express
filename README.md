# VisionGrid

## To-Do (I'll remove this section later)

Home page:

1. 99% done, modal images look questionable on small screens

Board page:

1. add functionality for up/down arrows to change the thumbnail & image/text order
2. I need a modal to confirm deleting a saved image
3. I need a modal for saved images - something way different and better than the home page modal
4. in savedImages.js, I'll need to implement the settings option (if and when I get to that) and maybe a button somewhere to start a slideshow of 1) just the images, and/or the images + text - allow user to set the timing
