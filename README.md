# VisionGrid

## To-Do

1. Home page: mostly done, just little CSS changes and I need to check for mobile which I have not done at att, and other edge cases
2. Board page:
   1. Create addSavedImagesToDom to add saved images to DOM, show editable image notes
   2. I need to somehow create/show icons when a thumbnail is clicked on - up/down arrows to change the image/text order, and an "X" to remove the saved image from localStorage, and therefore the thumbnails and on page
   3. I need a modal for saved images - something way different and better than the home page modal
   4. in thumbnails.js, I need to create the function for the move up/down and delete functionality on thumbnail click
   5. in savedImages.js, I'll need to implement the settings option (if and when I get to that) and maybe a button somewhere to start a slideshow of 1) just the images, and/or the images + text
